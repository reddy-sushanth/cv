## Clone the Git Repository 

Repository has following files :
<ol>

<li>Final Project Report</li>
<li>FinalProject.ipynb</li>
</ol>

## Upload the Dataset on Google drive and then use it in the google collab
The dataset is very large and it takes a lot of time to run on your system
Please use google collab and make sure you change the runtime to GPU.

Instructions to mount google drive on google collab is in the ipynb file.
Even Unpakcing/unzipping of the dataset is also there. 
Just upload it to Google Drive and run the first Two cells.
